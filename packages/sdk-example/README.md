# SDK Example

This folder contains an express.js server implementation example for the PlayHT SDK.

## Setup

To authenticate requests, you need to generate an API Secret Key and obtain your User ID. If you already have a PlayHT account, navigate to the [API access page](https://play.ht/studio/api-access). For more details [see the API documentation](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-authentication#generating-your-api-secret-key-and-obtaining-your-user-id).

Before running the examples, build the SDK:

```shell
cd ../playht
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Example Server

Create a new `.env` file in the `packages/sdk-example` folder by copying the `.env.example` file provided. Then edit the file with your credentials.

To run it locally:

```shell
yarn
yarn install:all
yarn start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the example server.
